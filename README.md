# Wine_Classifier

The project uses supervised learning to classify the wines in the data base.
There are 11 features that determine the wine's quality. 
The methods used are gini and entropy trees, random forest classifier, stochastic gradient decent, and support vector machine. The random forest classifer was the most accurate classifier object.
